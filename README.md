## Final Memory

A simple memory game inspired by the world of Final Fantasy from Square Enix.

[Final Memory - GitHub Pages](https://willhcurry.github.io/final-memory/)

This game currently completes the following game rules checklist:\

-At the start of the game, the user is presented with a grid of 24 facedown cards.\
-Each card looks identical face down, but has a face-up value that is matched by only one
other card on the table.\
-When the user clicks a card, it flips over revealing its value.\
-When the user clicks the next card, its value is revealed and then compared against the
other face up card. If they are equal, both cards disappear. If they are different, they flip
back down.\
-The game is continued until there are no cards left.\

It also keeps track of the number of turns used before completion of the game and is responsive to multiple screen resolutions.


I started coding this project on December 10th 2021. This is the first deployed build and is currently an incomplete project. The following features improvements are being added:

-Use typechecking with TypeScript.\
-A modal to show score and number of turns.\
-Final Fantasy music during gameplay and after game completion that will be toggleable with volume control.\
-Sounds effects for clicks and matched cards.\
-Sign up and sign in pages.\
-User data with scores to be saved into a database.\

Future developement improvements:
-Improved code and component structuring.
-Performance.
